# 🧠 Visual Data Structures in C++ with Qt & Graphviz

Welcome to this collection of classic and advanced data structures, fully implemented in **C++**, designed with **Qt Creator**, and visualized using **Graphviz**! This project was created to deepen the understanding of fundamental algorithms through clear, interactive, and visual implementations.

## 📁 Implemented Structures

Each structure is organized in its own module, with many featuring a graphical interface to enhance exploration and learning.

- 🔺 **AVL Tree**
- 🧱 **Binary Heap**
- 🔢 **Binomial Heap** (`binomial_Heap` and `Heap/Binomial Heap`)
- 📚 **Dictionary Translator**
- 📦 **Stack (`Pila`)**
- 🔄 **Linked Lists:**
  - `lista_simple` (Singly linked)
  - `lista_doble` (Doubly linked)
  - `circular_simple` (Circular singly linked)
  - `circular_doble` (Circular doubly linked)
  - `listaD` (Alternative doubly linked list)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🧠 **C++** – Core logic and structure implementation.
- 💻 **Qt Creator** – GUI development for structure interaction.
- 📊 **Graphviz (.dot)** – To visually represent complex structures like trees and heaps.
